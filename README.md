Capture 802.11 WiFi probe network names

This is a pretty rudimentary 802.11 probe network capture tool. It for the most part only works on Macs, and newer macs at that.
A more complex analysis tool in NodeJS or C++ would be more valuable

But this is a fun script.

# To Run:
- git clone https://github.com/falconscript/probe.sh.git
- chmod 777 ./probe.sh/probeCapture.sh
- ./probe.sh/probeCapture.sh
